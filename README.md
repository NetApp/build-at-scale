# DevOps@Scale

Another part of NetAppâ€™s next generation DevOps solutions is DevOps@Scale. DevOps@Scale is an open-source solution that uses Kubernetes, ONTAP and Trident to deliver an end-to-end developer workflow experience.
It aims at providing an accelerated application development and facilitates management of developer workspaces. Devops@Scale delivers an efficient workspace management and improves developer productivity.
The benefits come from leveraging ONTAP's thin provisioning storage technologies like Snapshot (TBD) and FlexClone.
The solution comprises of a variety of application components all of which are deployed and run as Kubernetes services. The DevOps@Scale web application provides a dashboard to access all the deployed Kubernetes services, create/delete/access development pipelines, and create/delete/merge developer workspaces. Developer workspaces can be accessed over the web via Theia and other integrated development environments.
